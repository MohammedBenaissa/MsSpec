MODULE ATOMIC_PROPERTIES
!
!  This module contains physical properties of the chemical elements, 
!    namely: The atomic mass, the density of all the 
!    elements,the various radii available in the literature, 
!    Debye temperatures and bulk, shear, Young moduli and Poisson ratio,  
!    the work function and the valence (integer and noninteger),
!    the electric resistivity and the lattice constants, 
!    the magnetic type.
